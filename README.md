# RPGAssistant
A small project in python, mainly intended to help me learn discord.py. RPGAssistant is a bot for my personal discord server where I play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. It's meant to help manage that server and quickly create new 'campaign categories' for different Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns that may take place.
